[DotNed](https://www.dotned.nl/) is the Dutch .NET user group and organizes several meetings each year for the .NET community.
They also run a regular podcast covering several .NET development related topics like Visual Studio, Mono, ASP.NET MVC, Windows Phone and Windows Azure.

Triggered by my scheduled [TechDays 2013 presentation](/2013/03/12/speaking-at-the-dutch-techdays-2013),
I was interviewed a few weeks ago by [Maurice de Beijer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mauricedebeijer/) about my experiences using Windows Azure to build a high available and scaling platform for the various applications used during "[3FM Serious Request](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/3FM_Serious_Request)".
