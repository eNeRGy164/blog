I am invited to speak at the [Techdays 2013](https://web.archive.org/web/20130313051947/http://www.microsoft.com/netherlands/techdays/home.aspx) in the Netherlands.
The event is held on the 7<sup>th</sup> & 8<sup>th</sup> of March at the World Forum in Den Haag.

My session, in Dutch, is called "**Serious Request met Windows Azure**" and I will be talking about my experiences using Windows Azure to build a high available and scaling platform for the various applications used during "[3FM Serious Request](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/3FM_Serious_Request)",
the annual charity event organized by the Dutch radio station 3FM for the [Dutch Red Cross](https://www.rodekruis.nl/).

If the schedule does not change, I will be speaking in the Africa Room on Friday between 13:15 - 14:30.

## Update

I have uploaded my [slides for this session](https://hompus.nl/presentations/Techdays%202013%20-%20Serious%20Request%20met%20Windows%20Azure.pptx) (PowerPoint PPTX, 6,83MB).  
You can also view my presentation on SlideShare (but the fonts get messed up):
