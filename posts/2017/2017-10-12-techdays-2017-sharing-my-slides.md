  Today I presented a session, in Dutch, titled 'Gebruik Azure Key Vault in je applicaties en zorg dat niemand achter je geheimen komt' during the TechDays 2017 event.
  The presentation is about using Azure Key Vault to improve security of your solutions.

  I’m sharing my slides and code, so you can start improving the security of your solutions and deployments using Azure Key Vault,
  the Azure Key Vault Configuration Provider and Azure Key Vault Storage Account Keys.

Today I presented a session, in Dutch, titled
"<span lang="nl">Gebruik Azure Key Vault in je applicaties en zorg dat niemand achter je geheimen komt</span>"
during the **TechDays 2017** event.

The session was about using Azure Key Vault to improve security of your solutions.

I would like to thank everyone attending this session. It was nice to see the room overflowing.
Too bad the demo gods did not feel worshipped enough, and had to mess up my Azure Storage connection. 🫤

I am sharing my slides and code,
so you can start improving the security of your solutions and deployments using [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/key-vault/),
the [Azure Key Vault Configuration Provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/key-vault-configuration) and
[Azure Key Vault Storage Account Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/secrets/overview-storage-keys).

The code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/eNeRGy164/TechDays2017NL).
