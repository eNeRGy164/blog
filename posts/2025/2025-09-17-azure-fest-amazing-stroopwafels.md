excerpt: >
  Azure Fest 2025 is packed with keynotes, deep dives, and hallway conversations.
  But the real buzz today isn't about cloud-native Kubernetes or AI workloads—
  it's about the afterparty. 

  Word on the conference floor is that Dutch cult band *The Amazing Stroopwafels*
  might surprise attendees with a performance during the closing drinks.

Azure Fest 2025 is in full swing today. The sessions covered everything from confidential computing to next-gen DevOps practices, and the energy in the corridors of the venue was nothing short of electric.

But while the talks sparked plenty of debate, the real buzz started once the drinks began to flow after the final session. Whispers spread quickly: **could it be true that Dutch band *The Amazing Stroopwafels* are about to perform?**

The Stroopwafels are no strangers to Dutch stages, but to see them close out a tech conference is something else entirely. Their quirky, down-to-earth songs have a cult following—half nostalgia, half folk-pop rebellion.

During the evening mingle, speaker [Michaël Hompus](/about) was overheard saying:

> If they play their obscure track **‘Fosfaat fabriek'**, I'll consider this the best Azure Fest ever.

Whether it's just a rumor or an actual surprise act remains to be seen. Either way, Azure Fest 2025 has already cemented itself as more than just another tech event—it's a gathering where cloud computing meets cultural curiosity.  

Stay tuned. If the Stroopwafels really do take the stage, we'll have the photos, the vibes, and maybe even some shaky phone recordings to prove it.
