  devNetNoord is packed with sessions on architecture, cloud, and code—but today's 
  strangest headline broke far outside the conference halls. Scientists claim to have 
  detected "land above Groningen," directly contradicting the region's beloved motto 
  *Er gaat niets boven Groningen*. The truth may be out there.

devNetNoord 2025 has the perfect vibe again this year: code-fueled discussions, quietly competitive badge scanning, and northern hospitality that somehow always includes bitterballen.

But during the afternoon sessions, a rumor emerged that instantly overshadowed even the most polished architecture diagrams.

**Scientists at the University of Groningen claim they’ve detected land *above* Groningen.**

Yes. Above. Groningen.  
A discovery that—if confirmed—would break centuries of local wisdom and invalidate countless marketing campaigns.

To make things even stranger, the leaked report references “unexplained geological activity” and a “topographical anomaly not visible to the human eye.” In other words: classic X-Files territory.

During the evening mingle, attendee and speaker [Michaël Hompus](/about) was heard saying:

> If this turns out to be true, I fully expect devNetNoord 2026 to feature a keynote by Mulder and Scully.

Witnesses later reported a faint humming sound outside the venue, followed by what one developer described as *“a perfectly spherical patch of fog hovering suspiciously close to the ceiling.”* When approached, the fog allegedly receded—upwards.

A few skeptics suggested the anomaly might simply be Wi-Fi interference from an overenthusiastic demo involving edge devices, Kubernetes, and a repurposed drone. But the timing left many unconvinced.

The devNetNoord organizers issued a short statement:

> “We are aware of reports of land above Groningen. At this moment, we can neither confirm nor deny its existence. Please continue enjoying the conference.”

Mulder would call that a confession.

Whether the anomaly is real, a scientific breakthrough, or a wildly successful viral stunt, one thing is clear:  
**something is happening above Groningen—and it’s happening during devNetNoord.**

Stay tuned. If the sky opens, the land rises, or someone spots a mysteriously glowing Stroopwafel-shaped craft, you’ll read about it here first.
