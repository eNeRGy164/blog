Hello there!

My name is Michaël Hompus, and I'm a developer and architect based in the Netherlands.
With a solid track record in delivering robust, scalable, and secure solutions for clients across diverse sectors such as Education, Health Care, Industry, and High Tech.
I've dedicated my career to leading and supporting teams in realizing innovative solutions using the Microsoft Cloud.

My passion for sharing knowledge has led me to become an active public speaker at user groups and conferences, as well as a Microsoft Certified Trainer.
My contributions to the community and extensive knowledge of Microsoft Azure have earned me the prestigious [Microsoft MVP award](https://mvp.microsoft.com/en-US/mvp/profile/1864ae73-f4bd-eb11-bacc-0022481f2c24).

If you're interested in inviting me to speak at your event or conference, you can find [my profile on sessionize.com](https://sessionize.com/michael-hompus).

I also enjoy helping out fellow developers by answering questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/581675/michaël-hompus).
