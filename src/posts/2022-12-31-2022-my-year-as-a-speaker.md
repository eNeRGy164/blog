In the past few years, I have presented multiple sessions all around the world, although mostly virtual.
Presenting for a live crowd was something I only did inside The Netherlands before COVID-19 struck the world.

With restrictions being lifted during the year of 2022,
new opportunities presented themselves and I was able to be in front of a live audience again and on some occasions,
even outside the country!

## dotNed meeting February

This was not my first time doing a [dotNed user group][DOTNED] session. The session was still only online.
It was interesting for me, because it was the first time, I would give my _Azure cost management_ related session.

In Dutch it was called <q>[Ons bint zuunig][DOTNED_ONS_BINT_ZUUNIG]</q>, setting the theme with [Zeeuws meisje][ZEEUWS_MEISJE].

## AzureLive

Still in a hybrid setup, the audience of [AzureLive][AZURELIVE] could watch the streams from home.
However, half of the presenters joined physically at the same location where the recordings took place.
It was nice to meet new people after doing everything virtually.

This was also my first time meeting [Henk Boelman][HENK_BOELMAN] and [Suzanne Daniels][SUZANNE_DANIELS] (my MCs),
[Stacy Cashmore][STACY_CASHMORE], and [Barbara Forbes][BARBARA_FORBES] as fellow speakers,
which I would join again at later conferences.

## dotNed Saturday

[dotNed Saturday][DOTNED_SATURDAY] is an event where I have had the honor of speaking for multiple years now.
I already did a talk about <q>Azure Key Vault</q> at the 2018 edition,
but for this year the content was updated to reflect the current state of the service.

I was joined by (amongst others) [Sander Molenkamp][SANDER_MOLENKAMP], [Roland Guijt][ROLAND_GUIJT],
[Marcel de Vries][MARCEL_DE_VRIES], and [Dennis Doomen][DENNIS_DOOMEN] as fellow speakers.

## IglooConf: Midsummer

The first time I had to travel by plane to get to my speaking gig!

Not only was [IglooConf][IGLOOCONF] a very nice 2-day conference in Helsinki ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡®,
it also meant multiple days being highly involved with the other speakers.
My session was about <q>Dapr, and how it can let you postpone architectural choices to a later moment in time</q>.

I really had a blast together with [Magnus MÃ¥rtensson][MAGNUS_MARTENSSON], [Glenn Colpaert][GLENN_COLPAERT],
[Alan Smith][ALAN_SMITH], [Karl Ots][KARL_OTS], [Mark Brown][MARK_BROWN], [Roberto Freato][ROBERTO_FREATO],
[Sakari Nahi][SAKARI_NAHI], [Rik Hepworth][RIK_HEPWORTH], [Andreas Erben][ANDREAS_ERBEN],
[Pieter Vandenheede][PIETER_VANDENHEEDE], and **Stacy**.
Many of whom I will join at later conferences again.

## Developer Week

This time I could take the train to the conference.
Joined by my colleagues [Hanno Embregts][HANNO_EMBREGTS] and [Peter Wessels][PETER_WESSELS]
we traveled to [Developer Week][DWX] in NÃ¼rnberg ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª.

Originally, I would only do my session on _Dapr_.
Due to many speaker cancellations, I also presented my sessions about _Azure cost management_
and <q>Using your source code to generate documentation</q>.

During the conference I was able to join up with **Dennis** and **Roland** again and have the privilege to spend some time with
[Rob Richardson][ROB_RICHARDSON], [Matteo Emili][MATTEO_EMILI], [Salvatore Merone][SALVATORE_MERONE],
[Scott Guymer][SCOTT_GUYMER], and [Niek Palm][NIEK_PALM].
Specially meeting Niek was fun as we went to school together over 25 years ago.

## Azure Fest

For this one I did not have to travel far as [Azure Fest][AZURE_FEST] was hosted at the [Info Support][INFO_SUPPORT] office.
My session was about _Azure cost management_ again, apparently a hot topic these days.

This was the first time meeting [Sam Vanhoutte][SAM_VANHOUTTE] as speaker,
but also joining up again with **Sander**, **Henk** and **Barbara** for a second time.

## K!K live

K!K live is a smaller meet-up in the Netherlands.
Still, I had some nice interaction with the audience during and after my session about _Azure cost management_.

## CloudBrew

This was my last session of 2022.
_(I had to cancel the [Dev-Cloud][DEV_CLOUD] and [.NET Developer][DDC] conferences in KÃ¶ln ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª due to personal circumstances)_.

I traveled, by car this time, to the nice city of Mechelen ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡ª.

Besides my session about _Azure cost management_, [CloudBrew][CLOUDBREW] felt like a nice reunion
meeting **Rik**, **Barbara**, **Roberto**, **Sam**, and **Pieter** again.

## 2023

Will I be speaking as often in 2023?
I do not know; it is up to the people judging CFPs and hoping my talks fit in with their programs.
But in January I am certain to hit the stage again.

## NDC London

After being a speaker at the [NDC London][NDC_LONDON] 2021 online edition,
this time I will be traveling by train to London ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§, together with my colleague **Sander**.

I am looking forward to meeting **Andreas**, **Magnus**, **Marcel**, **Pieter**, **Rob**,
**Sander**, **Stacy**, and **Suzanne** again on stage!
