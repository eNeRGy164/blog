Looking to make your PowerPoint slide titles more engaging and eye-catching?
When a single emoticon doesn't quite capture the message you want to convey,
why not combine multiple emoticons?  
In this quick guide,
I will show you how to stack emoticons in PowerPoint to create compelling and meaningful slide titles.

Let's take this boring slide:

![Slide with only the title text "Run locally"](/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/boring-run-locally.png 'Slide with only the title text "Run locally"')

> [!NOTE]
> I am only showing the top-left corner, the rest of the slide is even more boring.

We can add an emoticon to emphasize the _running_ part.

![Slide with the title "Run locally" prefixed with a running person emoticon](/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/running-emoticon.png 'Slide with the title "Run locally" prefixed with a running person emoticon')

But what if we also want to include the _local_ part?  
Let's add a house emoticon.

![Slide with the title "Run locally" prefixed with both a house and running person emoticon](/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/house-and-running-emoticons.png 'Slide with the title "Run locally" prefixed with both a house and running person emoticon')

This does not give the right feeling yet, what if we could combine the two a bit more?

Let's merge these two emoticons to set a scene.

1. Select the *running person* emoticon and choose <kbd>Font</kbd> > <kbd>Subscript</kbd>

   ![Font menu with the Subscript option checked](/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/font-dialog-subscript.png "Font menu with the Subscript option checked")

2. Select the *house* emoticon and choose <kbd>Font</kbd> > <kbd>Character Spacing</kbd> > <kbd>Condensed by 25pt</kbd>

   ![Font menu with the Character Spacing set to Condensed by 25pt](/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/font-dialog-character-spacing.png "Font menu with the Character Spacing set to Condensed by 25pt")

> [!NOTE]
> The actual value might depend on your font-size and emoticon-width.

![Slide with the title "Run locally" prefixed with a person running in front of a house emoticon](/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/house-and-running-emoticons-stacked.png 'Slide with the title "Run locally" prefixed with a person running in front of a house emoticon')

That is it! Much better!

## More examples

The same technique can be used to combine several other emoticons in this way.  
Just some random examples:

1. Run through the street
2. Finish 3<sup>rd</sup> in a cycling competition
3. Choose something from the menu
4. Sales of dinosaurs has increased recently
5. Save that thread
6. Comment on the shopping cart contents
