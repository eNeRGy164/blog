Stefan Goßner [reminds](https://blog.stefan-gossner.com/2010/01/07/is-your-sharepoint-2007-farm-already-on-service-pack-2-if-not-read-this/) us of the fact that support for WSS 3.0 SP1, SharePoint 2007 SP1 and Project Server SP1 will soon end.

<!--more-->

Support ends when the next service pack is out for over a year.
And SP2 was released <time datetime="2009-04-28">April 28th 2009</time> so SP1 won’t be supported from <time datetime="2010-04-29">April 29th 2010</time>, so roughly in 3 months.

Be sure to test & deploy your upgrade soon!
