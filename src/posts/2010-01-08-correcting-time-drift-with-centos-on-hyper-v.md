I was having trouble with the clock in my Linux Hyper-V VMs.
The time was constantly drifting forward.
Using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) only slowed the drift a bit down but often the NTP-service gave up after several days.

I tried a lot of NTP configurations, but basically the local clock was just unreliable.
Even using [rdate][RDATE] every 10 minutes was already showing backwards jumps of several seconds.
As one of my VMs is running dovecot this really was a problem because
[dovecot][DOVECOT] hates [time moving backwards][DOVECOT_TIME_MOVING_BACKWARDS].

I finally found the solution posted by Mat Mirabito in the blogpost
"[Linux (specifically CentOS running trixbox) gains excessive time on system clock][LINUX_GAINS_TIME_ON_SYSTEM_CLOCK]".

Edit `grub.conf` and add the following to the kernel line:

```ini title="grub.conf"
divider=10 clocksource=acpi_pm
```

After this it works likeâ€¦ clockwork ðŸ™‚
