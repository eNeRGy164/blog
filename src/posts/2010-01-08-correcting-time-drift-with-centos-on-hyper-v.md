I was having trouble with the clock in my Linux Hyper-V VMâ€™s.
The time was constantly drifting forward.
Using the Network Time Protocol (NTP) only slowed the drift a bit down but often the NTP-service gave up after several days.

I tried a lot of NTP configurations, but basically the local clock was just unreliable.
Even using [rdate](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rdate) every 10 minutes was already showing backwards jumps of several seconds.
As one of my VMs is running dovecot this really was a problem because [dovecot](https://www.dovecot.org/) hates [time moving backwards](https://doc.dovecot.org/2.3/admin_manual/errors/time_moved_backwards/).

I finally found the solution posted by Mat Mirabito in the blogpost
"[Linux (specifically CentOS running trixbox) gains excessive time on system clock](https://bloggymcblogface.blog/linux-specifically-centos-running-trixbox-gains-excessive-time-on-system-clock/)".

Edit `grub.conf` and add the following to the kernel line:

```ini
divider=10 clocksource=acpi_pm
```

After this it works likeâ€¦ clockwork ðŸ™‚
