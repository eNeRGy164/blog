I would like to thank everyone attending this session. It was nice to see the room overflowing.
Too bad the demo gods did not feel worshipped enough, and had to mess up my Azure Storage connection. ðŸ«¤

I am sharing my slides and code,
so you can start improving the security of your solutions and deployments using [Azure Key Vault](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/key-vault/),
the [Azure Key Vault Configuration Provider](https://learn.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/security/key-vault-configuration) and
[Azure Key Vault Storage Account Keys](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/secrets/overview-storage-keys).

The code is available at [GitHub](https://github.com/eNeRGy164/TechDays2017NL).
