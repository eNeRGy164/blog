To deploy our code, we create MSI installers using [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
One problem I encountered is that there is no property available in code to know where the user has chosen to install the application.

After some searching and testing, I now use the following code to get the installation path:

```csharp
// Installer Application Folder
string installPath = Context.Parameters["assemblypath"];
installPath = installPath.Substring(0, installPath.LastIndexOf("\\"));

if (!installPath.EndsWith("\\"))
{
  installPath += "\\";
}
```

That is all!
