This weekend I was speaking at [WordCamp Nijmegen](https://2018.nijmegen.wordcamp.org/)
about the possibilities of hosting a WordPress site using Microsoft Azure.

Even though I expected to get some criticism for dropping the Microsoft name at such an event,
I felt very welcome.
I experienced the event as a large group of very warm people from all over the world that are coming together to help each other out.
And like Microsoft nowadays, they set a high standard with their
[code of conduct](https://2018.nijmegen.wordcamp.org/info/gedragscode/) ([in English](http://opensourcebridge.org/about/code-of-conduct/)).

I am sharing my Dutch slides here, and the recording for WordPress TV on YouTube.
