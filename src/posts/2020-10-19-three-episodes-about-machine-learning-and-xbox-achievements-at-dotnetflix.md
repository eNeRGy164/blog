  I had the honor to be a guest at the dotnetFlix channel, hosted by Sander Molenkamp and Edwin van Wijk.
  I share more on the techniques, frameworks and libraries I have used and I finish with a demonstration of the finished application.

  As there was so much to share, it did not fit in a single episode, so we recorded three parts!

In my previous post, I shared that I would be [speaking about getting Xbox achievements using Machine Learning](/2020/10/11/speaking-about-machine-learning-and-xbox-achievements)
at the .NET Virtual Conference and the [dotNed user group](https://dotned.nl).

In the meantime, I had the honor to be a guest at the [dotnetFlix channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/dotnetFlix/),
hosted by [Sander Molenkamp](https://www.sandermolenkamp.com/) and [Edwin van Wijk](https://github.com/EdwinVW).

I share more on the techniques, frameworks and libraries I have used like EmguCV, EPPlus and ML.NET.
I end with a short demonstration of the running application.

As there was so much to share, it did not fit in a single episode. So, we recorded three!
