I have a clean install on the latest and greatest: Windows Server 2008, SQL Server 2008 and MOSS 2007 SP1 with all updates.
This is the layout of my farm:

```plain
http://<server>:80   - Portal  
http://<server>:8000 - Central Admin  
http://<server>:8001 - SSP
http://mysite        - MySites
```

Everything works fine, except the search crawl gave Access Denied errors on `http://mysite` and `sps3://mysite`.

I checked everything, but could only find this in the Application event log:

```plain frame="shell" title="Application Event Log"
The start address <http://mysite> cannot be crawled.
Context: Application 'SharedServices1', Catalog 'Portal_Content'
Details:
Access is denied. Check that the Default Content Access Account
has access to this content, or add a crawl rule to crawl this
content.   (0x80041205)
```

Also the Security event log says:

```plain  frame="shell" title="Security Event Log"
An account failed to log on.

I had a hard time finding the solution, until I encountered Ron Grzywacz's Blog:
[Crawling Issue with .NET 3.5 SP1](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/coreinfrastructureandsecurityblog/crawling-issue-with-net-3-5-sp1/333193).

Although **KB896861** only mentions Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, it seems to fix the issue on Windows Server 2008 as well.

So to fix this:

1. Click **Start**, click **Run**, type `regedit`, and then click **OK**
2. In Registry Editor, locate and then click the following registry key: `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\MSV1_0`
3. Right-click **MSV1_0**, point to **New**, and then click **Multi-String Value**
4. Type `BackConnectionHostNames`, and then press ENTER.
5. Right-click **BackConnectionHostNames**, and then click **Modify**
6. In the **Value data** box, type the host name or the host names for the sites that are on the local computer, and then click **OK**
7. Quit the Registry Editor, and then restart the IISAdmin service

It worked immediately!
