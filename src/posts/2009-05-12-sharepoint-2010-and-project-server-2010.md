As announced yesterday by Microsoft, the Office 2010 products will be 64bit only in the future.
Well, no surprise there, we already knew that.
But they went even further.

<!--more-->

Because of their experience with customer implementations of the 2007 series they recognize that
having Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server on 64bit is a must for ensuring the best performance possible.
Therefore the 2010 series of products will only be available on those versions!

Also, on the client side there will be an improvement as Internet Explorer 6 will not be supported anymore.

So, to summarize:

- SharePoint Server & Project Server 2010 will be _64-bit only_
- SharePoint Server & Project Server 2010 will require _64-bit Windows Server 2008 or 2008R2_
- SharePoint Server & Project Server 2010 will require _64-bit SQL Server 2005 or 2008_ (But you should choose 2008)
- SharePoint Server & Project Server 2010 will only support _Internet Explorer 7 or 8_
