The past couple of weeks I am working with Silverlight controls embedded in SharePoint 2007.  
For one of the controls, I need to retrieve the data using the [Search Query Web Service][SEARCH_QUERY_WEB_SERVICE].

This was working perfectly in the development environment.
But when deploying the control to the production environment it did not work.

<!--more-->

I was using the following code:

```csharp
private void Page_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
  var endpoint = new EndpointAddress(GetParam("SharePointWeb") + "/_vti_bin/search.asmx");
  var binding = new BasicHttpBinding(BasicHttpSecurityMode.None)
                {
                    Name = "QueryServiceSoap",
                    MaxReceivedMessageSize = 2147483647,
                    MaxBufferSize = 2147483647
                };

  var client = new QueryServiceSoapClient(binding, endpoint);
  client.QueryExCompleted += this.ClientQueryExCompleted;
  client.QueryExAsync(GetParam("Query"));
}
```

After some digging, I found that the control did actually work,
but only when the page was visited over an HTTP connection.
As visitors were accessing the page over an HTTPS connection,
I was pointed in the direction of the connection between the control and the web service.

As can be seen in the code the WCF client is used and I remembered that the binding security mode is different if you want to work with HTTPS.
So, I changed the [BasicHttpSecurityMode][BASIC_HTTP_SECURITY_MODE] from `None` to `Transport`.

```diff
-var binding = new BasicHttpBinding(BasicHttpSecurityMode.None)
+var binding = new BasicHttpBinding(BasicHttpSecurityMode.Transport)
```

After deploying the control again, it worked nicely over the HTTPS connection,
so I knew what the source of my problem is.
But naturally I want a generic solution so the configuration of the access mapping is not influencing the functioning of the control.

The question is how to detect if the control is hosted on a page over an HTTP or HTTPS connection.
This can be found in the [`SilverlightHost.Source` property][SOURCE_PROPERTY] which can be compared against the
[`Uri.UriSchemeHttp` field][URI_SCHEME_HTTP_FIELD] or the [`Uri.UriSchemeHttps` field][URI_SCHEME_HTTPS_FIELD].

As a result, this is my final code:

```csharp
private void Page_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
{
  var basicHttpSecurityMode =
      (Application.Current.Host.Source.Scheme == Uri.UriSchemeHttp)
        ? BasicHttpSecurityMode.None
        : BasicHttpSecurityMode.Transport;

  var endPoint = new EndpointAddress(GetParam("SharePointWeb") + "/_vti_bin/search.asmx");
  var binding = new BasicHttpBinding(basicHttpSecurityMode)
                {
                    Name = "QueryServiceSoap",
                    MaxReceivedMessageSize = 2147483647,
                    MaxBufferSize = 2147483647
                };

  var client = new QueryServiceSoapClient(binding, endPoint);
  client.QueryExCompleted += this.ClientQueryExCompleted;
  client.QueryExAsync(GetParam("Query"));
}
```

Works like a charm.
