As I wrote in <time datetime="2010-01-11">January</time>
"[WSS 3.0, SharePoint 2007 and Project Server SP1 support ends soon](/2010/01/11/wss-3-0-sharepoint-2007-and-project-server-sp1-support-ends-soon/)".
But today I discovered Microsoft has extended the support for installations of Windows SharePoint Services 3.0 SP1,
Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 SP1 and Project Server 2007 SP1.
