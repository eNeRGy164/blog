After having major, and unsolvable, problems with [MovableType](https://movabletype.org/) (MovableType was causing segfaults in Perl) for over half a year I finally switched to WordPress for hosting my blog.

I did consider SharePoint Server 2010 for hosting my blog, but the out-of-the-box support is nowhere near the possibilities with [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) (or any other major blogging framework).

### Configuration

After trying some themes, I settled for the "Paperpunch Theme" by [The Theme Foundry](https://thethemefoundry.com/).

This is completed with the following plugins:

- **Akismet**  
   Akismet checks your comments against the Akismet web service to see if they look like spam or not.
- **Google XML Sitemaps**  
   This plugin will generate a special XML sitemap which will help search engines like Google, Yahoo, Bing and Ask.com to better index your blog.
- **SI CAPTCHA Anti-Spam**  
   Adds CAPTCHA anti-spam methods to WordPress on the comment form, registration form, login, or all.
   This prevents spam from automated bots.
- **TweetMeme Retweet Button**  
   Adds a button which easily lets you retweet your blog posts.
- **Twitter Widget Pro**  
   A widget that properly handles twitter feeds, including @username, #hashtag, and link parsing.
- **WP Super Cache**  
   Very fast caching plugin for WordPress.

If somebody has comments or suggestions, please let me now.
