excerpt: >
  This week I gave a presentation at Winvision and recorded it in Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007.
  The resulting recording is a webpage with multiple streams: desktop video, presenter video and audio.
  The problem is that the codec used doesn't work on x64 systems or Windows 7 (Server).
  Watching the separate streams isn't really an option because there is no audio included in the video streams.
  But I got lucky as it seems Microsoft has released a new tool called “Recording Converter for Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007” only last month.

But I got lucky as it seems Microsoft has released a new tool called "**Recording Converter for Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007**" only last month.

This tool allows you to convert a Live Meeting recording into a WMV file.
You can choose the output resolution and, optionally, you can include the presenter and/or panoramic video streams.

It takes one hour to process, my presentation was nearly 2 hours, and now I have a file most video players can render.
