title: Make your PowerPoint Presentation look good on a wide screen projector

excerpt: >
  The other day I attended a meeting where the presenter switched from a PowerPoint slide to demonstrate an application.
  When he made the switch it was quite obvious the beamer was setup to only display the 4:3 slides to the maximum of the white screen.
  Since his desktop was in a 16:10 resolution the application was falling of the screen on both sides.

  While I was preparing a presentation myself I wanted to be sure my presentation would be in the same resolution as my desktop as I would be switching between my slides and Visual Studio.

The other day I attended a meeting where the presenter switched from a PowerPoint slide to demonstrate an application.
When he made the switch, it was quite obvious the beamer was setup to only display the 4:3 slides to the maximum of the white screen.
Since his desktop was in a 16:10 resolution the application was falling off the screen on both sides. Which was quite a distraction.

When I was preparing a presentation myself, I wanted to be sure my presentation would be in the same resolution as my desktop as I would be switching between my slides and Visual Studio.

## Choosing your Aspect Ratio

For presentations on a beamer or screen there are 3 common [aspect ratio's](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect_ratio_(image)>) at the moment: 4:3, 16:9 and 16:10.
If you don't know the ratio you can use the maximum resolution to determine the required ratio.

## 4:3

This is the classic resolution for computer screens.
This is also the default for PowerPoint.
800x600, 1024x768, 1152x864 and 1280x960 are common resolutions used with the ratio.

If you show a slide on wide screen you will get black bars on the side.

## 16:9

This ratio is commonly used by HD screens and beamers.
1366x768, 1280x720, 1600x900 and 1920x1080 are common resolutions used with this ratio.

If you show a slide in this ratio on a 4:3 or 16:10 screen you will get black bars on the top and bottom.

## 16:10

This ratio was commonly used by modern screen and beamers, but is now disappearing.
1280x800, 1440x900 and 1920x1200 are common resolutions used with the ratio.

If you show a slide in this ratio on a 4:3 screen you will get black bars on the top and bottom.
On a 16:9 screen you will get black bars on the side.

## Setting the aspect ratio in PowerPoint

It's easy to set the required aspect ratio:

1. In PowerPoint go the <kbd>Design</kbd> tab on the ribbon.
2. Click on <kbd>Page Setup</kbd>.
