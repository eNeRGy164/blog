Recently I wrote [an article about getting all prediction scores from your ML.NET model](/2020/09/14/get-all-prediction-scores-from-your-ml-net-model).
So, when we want to do this for an ONNX model we have loaded with ML.NET,
that should work the same, right?

Not really. Depending on the version of [ML.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/ai/ml-dotnet),
the data types of the downloaded [Azure Custom Vision](https://www.customvision.ai/) ONNX model are very hard to map on the .NET data types we use.

In this article I will show how we can get the labels and scores from an ONNX model prediction in C#.

> I have described how to set up the code to get predictions from the model.
> In this article we will build on top of that code.

## The prediction engine

Let us start with creating an instance of the prediction engine as we did in the previous post.
The engine is loaded with a model that we exported from the custom vision portal.

```csharp
var mlContext = new MLContext();

var transformer = mlContext.Transforms
  .ResizeImages("image", 224, 224, "Image")
  .Append(mlContext.Transforms.ExtractPixels("data", "image"))
  .Append(
    mlContext.Transforms.ApplyOnnxModel("classLabel", "data", "model.onnx")
  )
  .Fit(mlContext.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(new List<ImageInputData>()));

var predictionEngine = mlContext.Model
  .CreatePredictionEngine<ImageInputData, ImagePrediction>(transformer);
```

At this moment, the `ImagePrediction` class holds only the predicted label.
For this article, the `ImageInputData` class is not relevant.

```csharp
public class ImagePrediction
{
  [ColumnName("classLabel")]
  public string[] Labels;
}
```

Calling the `Predict` method on the engine will return a `ImagePrediction` object
with `Labels` holding the value of the highest scoring label.

```csharp
var modelOutput = this.predictionEngine.Predict(inputData);
// modelOutput.Labels[0] <- highest scoring label
```

## Getting the scores

I have already written what the benefit of getting the scores on your prediction is in the previous article, but to repeat myself:

> Trusting the model and accepting the highest score blindly might not be wise.
> If none of the labels really match, all values are close to 0%.
> And you get the label that scored just a tiny bit better than the others.
> You might see strange behavior in your application as prediction might be random and/or completely wrong.
>
> To prevent this, consider a threshold that needs to be exceeded before accepting the prediction for further use.
> But in the current model, there is no score. So how can we retrieve a prediction score?

### Extending the output model

First, extend the model to get all scores back. And here it gets interesting.
In [Netron](https://netron.app/), the datatype of the `loss` property is shown as a `sequence` of `map`s with a `string` key and a `float` value.

![Screenshot of Netron showing the output properties.](/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/netron-output-properties.png "Output properties as shown in Netron.")

Extend the class with the loss property.

```csharp {6-7}
private class ImagePrediction
{
  [ColumnName("classLabel")]
  public string[] Labels { get; set; }

  [ColumnName("loss")]
  public List<Dictionary<string, float>> Scores { get; set; }
}
```

We must also make sure the transformer will output the `loss` property as a column. For this we need to change the parameters of the `ApplyOnnxModel` method.

```csharp {4-8}
var transformer = mlContext.Transforms
  .ResizeImages("image", 224, 224, "Image")
  .Append(mlContext.Transforms.ExtractPixels("data", "image"))
  .Append(
    mlContext.Transforms.ApplyOnnxModel(
      new[] { "classLabel", "loss" },
      new[] { "data" }, "model.onnx")
  )
  .Fit(mlContext.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(new List<ImageInputData>()));
```

## The issue

Then running the code, this will result in the following runtime exception:

```plain
System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: 'Could not determine an IDataView type for member Scores (Parameter 'rawType')'
```

Changing the data types to an array or any of the different collection types did not seems to matter.
Also specifying a [`OnnxSequenceTypeAttribute` class](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.ml.transforms.onnx.onnxsequencetypeattribute)
with several data types did not resolve the situation.

Sometimes a different exception is thrown, but this is not helping to get it resolved.

```plain
System.InvalidOperationException: 'Can't bind the IDataView column 'loss' of type 'Microsoft.ML.Transforms.Onnx.OnnxSequenceType' to field or property 'Scores' of type 'IEnumerable`1[Dictionary`2[String, Single]]'.'
```

Looking at the source code of the
[`OnnxTypeParser` class](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/src/Microsoft.ML.OnnxTransformer/OnnxTypeParser.cs),
we can find some interesting lines of code and comments that can get us on the right track.

```csharp {5-6,11}
…

else if (typeProto.ValueCase == OnnxCSharpToProtoWrapper.TypeProto.ValueOneofCase.SequenceType)
{
    // Now, we see a Sequence in ONNX. If its element type is T, the variable produced by
    // ONNXRuntime would be typed to IEnumerable<T>.
…

else if (typeProto.ValueCase == OnnxCSharpToProtoWrapper.TypeProto.ValueOneofCase.MapType)
{
    // Entering this scope means a ONNX Map (equivalent to IDictionary<>) will be produced.
```

So, it seems that sequences are tightly connected to `IEnumerable`,
and maps are tightly connected to `IDictionary`.
Any deviation from this will result in an exception.

So, let us change the datatype to `IEnumerable<IDictionary<string, float>>`
and set the `OnnxSequenceTypeAttribute` to `IDictionary<string, float>`.

```csharp {7-8}
private class ImagePrediction
{
    [ColumnName("classLabel")]
    public string[] Labels { get; set; }

    [ColumnName("loss")]
    [OnnxSequenceType(typeof(IDictionary<string, float>))]
    public IEnumerable<IDictionary<string, float>> Scores { get; set; }
}
```

This removes the exception, and the prediction now holds a lot more information.

### ML.NET 1.5.1+

With the release of ML.NET 1.5.1, when the `OnnxSequenceTypeAttribute` is not defined on the `Scores` property,
a much more helpful exception is thrown:

```plain {2}
System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException: 'The expected type 'IEnumerable`1[IDictionary`2[String, Single]]' does not match the type of the 'loss' member: 'List`1[IDictionary`2[String, Single]]'.
Please change the loss member to 'IEnumerable`1[IDictionary`2[String, Single]]' (Parameter 'actualType')'
```

This is a great improvement if you run into this exact situation.

As of version [1.5.2](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/releases/tag/v1.5.2),
this same exception is now also thrown if the `OnnxSequenceTypeAttribute` _is_ defined, awesome!

## Using the scores

With everything wired up correctly,
it is now easy to get the actual score of the highest scoring label.

```csharp
var label = modelOutput.Labels[0];
var score = modelOutput.Scores.First()[modelOutput.Labels[0]];
```

Or if we want to get top scoring labels,
we can sort the dictionary and take the top ten.

```csharp
var top10scores = modelOutput.Scores
  .First()
  .OrderByDescending(kv => kv.Value)
  .Take(10);
```

For ONNX models in ML.NET, the mapping of data types is a little tricky,
but knowing how to define this correctly,
we can do more with a prediction than only taking the highest scoring label.
