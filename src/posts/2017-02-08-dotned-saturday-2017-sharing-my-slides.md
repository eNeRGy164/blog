Last month I gave my session, in Dutch,
titled "<span lang="nl">**Serious Request, Azure als schaalbaar platform**</span>"
during the [dotNed Saturday](https://dotnedsaturday.nl/) event.

First, I’d like to thank everyone attending this session.

The session was about my experiences using Microsoft Azure to build a high available,
secure and scalable platform for digital donations.

This platform is used during "[3FM Serious Request](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/3FM_Serious_Request)",
the annual charity event organized by the Dutch radio station 3FM for [the Dutch Red Cross](https://www.rodekruis.nl).

I am sharing my slides so you can use my guides,
tips & tricks to start building awesome, secure,
scalable, performing and monitorable web platforms using Azure.
