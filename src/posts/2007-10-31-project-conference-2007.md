It has been a while having time and content to post on this blog but I am back again. ðŸ™‚

I am currently at the Project Conference 2007 in Seattle and by visiting the sessions and talking to the guys at Microsoft developing the solution I got a lot of answers for things I could not find on the web or in the SDK.  
The next couple of weeks I will try to post the things I found out.

Also, [Prometric](https://www.prometric.com/) was present so you could do the official Project exams. Being bold I just entered the "Managing Projects with Microsoft Office Project Server" exam and guess what, I am now a *Microsoft Certified Technology Specialist*!
