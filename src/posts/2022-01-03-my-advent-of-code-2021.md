Although [Eric Wastl][WASTL] has been organizing the [Advent of Code][AOC] since 2015.
I only discovered it recently when some colleagues invited me to join the 2021 edition.

During the first 25 days of December, the challenges made me (re)discover many possibilities with C#,
some that are long available but maybe not that well known.

## Solutions

I had a blast (and some frustration ðŸ˜‰) solving the challenges, starting early morning, every day.

Some of the noteworthy concepts I have used:

- Records, both `class` (C# 9.0) and `struct` (C# 10.0) based.
- Converting data (bits to `int` with bit shifting, `char` to decimal using _addition_ or _subtraction_, etc.).
- Efficiently read and slice strings, arrays, and lists using `Index` and `Range` (C# 8.0).
- Work with `Stack<T>` (.NET Framework 2.0), `SortedSet<T>` (.NET Framework 4.0), and `HashSet<T>` (.NET Framework 4.7.2).
- Using `init` only setters, `with` expressions and target typed `new` expressions (all C#9.0).
- Many, many moreâ€¦

I have put all my code and descriptions in my [AdventOfCode2021][GITHUB_REPO] repo on GitHub.  
Maybe this also inspires you to discover a new feature you were not aware of yet!
