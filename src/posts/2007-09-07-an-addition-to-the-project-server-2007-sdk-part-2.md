I was browsing through the Project Server 2007 [`TimePeriodDataSet.TimePeriodsRow` members](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2007/ms479524(v=office.12)) and found there were some empty entries in the SDK.

The following empty entries I could fill:

| Name                  | Description                                                                                             | Enumeration                                                                          |

| TS_WEEK_STARTS_ON     | Specifies the first day of the week for this timesheet.                                                 | 0 = Sunday 1 = Monday 2 = Tuesday 3 = Wednesday 4 = Thursday 5 = Friday 6 = Saturday |
| WPRD_UID              | Specifies the period unique identifier of the time period.                                              |                                                                                      |
