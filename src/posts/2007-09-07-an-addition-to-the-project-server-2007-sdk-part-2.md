I was browsing through the Project Server 2007 [`TimePeriodDataSet.TimePeriodsRow` members](https://learn.microsoft.com/previous-versions/office/developer/office-2007/ms479524(v=office.12)) and found there were some empty entries in the SDK.

The following empty entries I could fill:

| Name                  | Description                                                                                             | Enumeration                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| RES_TIMESHEET_MGR_UID | Specifies the resource unique identifier of the (next)<br>enterprise resource reviewing on this timesheet. |                                                                                      |
| TS_WEEK_STARTS_ON     | Specifies the first day of the week for this timesheet.                                                 | 0 = Sunday<br>1 = Monday<br>2 = Tuesday<br>3 = Wednesday<br>4 = Thursday<br>5 = Friday<br>6 = Saturday |
| WPRD_UID              | Specifies the period unique identifier of the time period.                                              |                                                                                      |
